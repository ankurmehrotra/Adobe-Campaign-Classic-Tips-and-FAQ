## Welcome to Adobe Campaign Classic Tips and FAQ Pages

This page is setup to help fellow Adobe Campaign developers and users in some common and not so common challenges during development. This is not an official guide.
I have been working with Adobe Campaign for multiple years, and yet every few days I need to either find answers to new questions or learn from some amazing colleagues who know a better way.

Feel free to browse and find answers. If you like my work and if it was helpful to you, you can buy me a coffee! [![Image](https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ankurmehrotra)
